/**
 * Guards against malformed Tailwind opacity modifiers.
 *
 * These are not style nits — a class like `ring-white/30/40` or `border-white/`
 * matches no Tailwind utility and compiles to **nothing**, so the intended
 * border/ring/background silently does not render. A scripted colour migration
 * (commit 3fe5698) introduced 167 of them across 67 files, ~10 of which were
 * `focus-visible:` rings. The result was store cards, the checkout inputs and
 * the shared Dropdown having *no visible keyboard focus indicator at all* —
 * a direct violation of the hard constraints in docs/design-direction.md.
 *
 * They are invisible to `tsc`, to ESLint, and to a passing build, which is why
 * they survived several review passes. This test is the only thing that catches
 * them, so it deliberately scans source text rather than rendered output.
 */

/**
 * Every tracked source file we style in, minus this one.
 *
 * Excluding self is load-bearing, not tidiness: the patterns below are spelled
 * out verbatim in this file's comments and test names, so a scan that included
 * it would always report three false positives. That is not hypothetical — the
 * first version of this test omitted the filter and passed anyway, because
 * `git ls-files` lists only *tracked* files and the test was still untracked
 * when it ran. Committing it was what turned it red.
