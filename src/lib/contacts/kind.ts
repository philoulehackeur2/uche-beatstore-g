/**
 * Contact kind — "is this someone I send beats to, or someone who bought
 * from me?" derived from behavior, not from free text.
 *
 * THE GAP THIS CLOSES. `role`, `label`, and `category` are all free-text
 * columns different code paths have written inconsistently over time (the
 * table falls back through `role || label || category`) — none of them
 * reliably answer the one question a producer actually asks when scanning
 * the CRM: what IS this person to me? Meanwhile the signals that would
 * answer it precisely already exist and are already fetched for lead
 * scoring: purchases, beat_sends, and buyer-account favorites.
 *
 * Purchases outrank everything — money changing hands is a stronger,
 * less ambiguous signal than a role field a producer typed in once and
 * never revisited. Pure and tested, same convention as scoring.ts.
