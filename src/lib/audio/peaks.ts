/**
 * Server-side waveform peak extraction.
 *
 * WHY: WaveSurfer.js otherwise re-decodes the entire audio file in the
 * browser to render the waveform — that's the chief reason the player
 * feels heavy on long tracks. Precomputing peaks at upload + serving
 * them as a tiny JSON sidecar lets WaveSurfer skip the decode entirely
 * and draw the waveform from the cached numbers.
 *
 * The format is intentionally minimal: a single normalized channel of
 * `length` samples in -1..1. WaveSurfer renders fine from that, the
 * file gzips down to a few KB, and there's no schema versioning game.
 *
 * NEVER import this from a client component — it pulls in audio-decode.
