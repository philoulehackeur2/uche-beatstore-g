 * Buyer data erasure (GDPR / CCPA "right to be forgotten").

 * Buyers have no account — their only PII is the email captured at checkout
 * (and the Stripe customer id) stored on purchase records. We must be able to
 * honour an erasure request, but we can't simply delete the rows: the producer
 * has a legitimate-interest / legal basis to retain the *transaction* (amount,
 * date, what was sold) for accounting and tax. So we **anonymise** instead —
 * strip the PII, keep the financial shell.
 *
 * The replacement email is a deterministic, irreversible pseudonym so the
 * record stays internally consistent (and a repeat erasure is a no-op) without
 * being able to recover the original address.
