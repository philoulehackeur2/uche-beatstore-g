/**
 * DELETE /api/projects/[id]/comments/[commentId]
 *
 * Soft-deletes a comment on the owner's project. We use a soft delete so
 * the audit trail survives — the row remains, `deleted_at` is stamped,
 * and the comment is filtered out of both the owner panel and the public
 * reader. Authored content (especially guest comments from share links)
 * is the kind of thing you might want to recover later if a recipient
 * complains they were misquoted.
 *
 * Ownership flows through the parent project, not the comment row itself
 * — guests aren't tracked as users, so we can't gate on "did the caller
 * author this comment." The project owner is the authoritative moderator.
