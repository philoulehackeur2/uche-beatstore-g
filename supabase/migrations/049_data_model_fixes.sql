-- 049_data_model_fixes.sql
-- Three data-model fixes that came out of the post-storefront audit:
--
--  1. projects.user_id must be NOT NULL. Verification turned up
--     legacy rows ("Project 01") with NULL user_id. The store route
--     guards against it but it's a data-integrity smell and breaks
--     the assumption every other producer-side query makes.
--     Backfills any nulls to the single creator_profiles row first
--     (single-producer assumption), then sets NOT NULL.
--
--  2. project_access_links gets a denormalised seller_user_id
--     column. Before this change /api/sales had to JOIN through
--     projects.user_id to scope by owner, and the row would orphan
--     if the project was ever deleted. seller_user_id is written
--     by the Stripe webhook at insert time (same value as the
--     project's user_id at time of purchase). Backfills existing
--     rows from projects.user_id.
--
--  3. store_plays table. share_plays is scoped to DM'd share-link
--     tokens only; public storefront previews/plays didn't count
--     anywhere. /analytics undercounted plays. New table mirrors
--     share_plays shape but is scoped per-track per-seller with
--     no link_token requirement. Inserted via a public
--     /api/store/play endpoint (rate-limited by IP hash).
--
-- Idempotent (IF NOT EXISTS) on all DDL. Safe to re-run.
