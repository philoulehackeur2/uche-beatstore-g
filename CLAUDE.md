# CLAUDE.md

Working notes for LLM agents. Product spec lives in AGENTS.md.

**Before a UI pass** read `docs/design-direction.md` (binding visual spec) — the colour section below summarises it, but the doc wins.
**Before a schema change** read `supabase/MIGRATIONS.md` (applied-status ledger + numbering).
**Before a large pass** skim the tail of `docs/codex-execution-log.md` — it records what was just changed and why.

## Claude agent setup

Project-specific Claude orchestration and specialist guidance live in `.claude/agents/` and `.claude/skills/`.
Default to `orchestrator` for autonomous routing, then let it delegate to `planner`, `app-router`, `ui-system`, `supabase-data`, `commerce-storefront`, and `qa-test` as needed while loading the matching skill files before implementation.

**U2C Beatstore** (internal name `antigravity`). Single-producer beatstore: a private dashboard for managing tracks and a public storefront for selling them. Prod: `uche-beatstore-g.vercel.app`.

## Conventions

**API** — folder per resource, `route.ts` exports `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE`. All mutations Zod-validated via `lib/contracts/`. Owner gating via `requireRowOwnership(table, id)` or `requireUser()` from `lib/auth/ownership.ts`. Service-role client (`createServiceClient()`) only after ownership verified. Errors: `{ error: string }` + `errorMessage(err)`. Logging: `createLogger('api.x.y')`.

**UI** — near-black neutral surfaces, silver-on-black text, colour used only to signal. Type: H1 40px `font-heading`, labels 10px mono uppercase tracking-[0.2em]. Use `Dropdown` over `<select>`. Bulk = `BatchActionBar` + `Set<string>` selection state. Feedback = `toast.*` / `confirmToast` from `useToast` (queue policy — cap 4, dedupe, hover-pause — lives in `lib/ui/toast-queue.ts`, not in the store setter). Overlays use `useDialogBehavior` (dialogs: full focus trap; menus/popovers: `trapFocus: false`, Escape only). Fonts: Akira Expanded (body), Synkopy (`.font-heading`), Panchang (`.font-mono`) — all `/public/fonts`, no CDN imports.

## Colour + design tokens

**Read this before styling anything. The old `#D4BFA0` burnt-amber palette documented here is GONE and following it has already produced wrong-looking work.**

*What components actually use* (counts are occurrences across `src/**/*.tsx`, so match these, not the CSS variables):

| Role | Use | Count |
|---|---|---|
| Page background | `#090907` | 369 |
| Card / panel | `#0D0D0A` | 152 |
| Text primary | `text-white/80` | 398 |
| Text secondary | `text-white/60` | 504 |
| Text tertiary / labels | `text-white/40` | 1000 |
| Text faint | `text-white/30` | 211 |
| Border default | `border-white/10` | 808 |
| Border hover / emphasis | `border-white/20` | 459 |
| Mint (free, success, positive) | `#6DC6A4` | 235 |
| Tan accent (sparing) | `#c8a47a` | 87 |
| Star gold | `#c8a84b` | 15 |

**Text and borders are white at alpha, not warm hexes.** `globals.css` does define `--bg-page` / `--bg-card` / `--accent` and a `--dr-*` scale, but components overwhelmingly bypass them, so a value copied from the variables lands off-palette against its neighbours. This table previously listed `#0a0907` / `#14110d` / `#D4BFA0` / `#E8DCC8` / `#6a5d4a` / `#1f1a13` — a warm set that survives almost nowhere in the app, and the cover art editor was built against it and came out visibly brown next to everything else. Verify against neighbouring components before trusting any palette written down here.

Underneath the table there is a real token layer, defined in `src/app/globals.css` (`:root`) and specified in `docs/design-direction.md`. Reach for a variable rather than a literal when you have the choice — `[data-theme="de-roche-archive"]` only re-themes what goes through the tokens — but do not "fix" a neighbouring hardcoded hex on that basis: most of the app is still literals, and a lone variable in a screen full of `#090907` is the thing that looks wrong.

Two layers coexist, deliberately:

- **De Roche primitives** — `--dr-black-950 #0B0B0A` … `--dr-paper-100 #EEE8DD`. Source values. Don't reach for these in components.
- **Semantic aliases** — what components use: `--background-primary/secondary/elevated`, `--surface-primary/secondary/hover/active/selected`, `--text-primary/secondary/tertiary/disabled`, `--border-subtle/default/strong/focus`, `--brand-primary #C4B49C` (+ `-hover`, `-active`), `--success #6FA58A`, `--warning #C88B46`, `--information #71A4B5`, waveform band colours `--wave-low` … `--wave-air`.

Legacy app tokens are now **aliases onto the semantic layer** — `--bg-page` → `--background-primary`, `--bg-card` → `--surface-primary`, `--bg-hover` → `--surface-hover`, `--accent` → `--brand-primary`, `--border` → `--border-default`. They still work; they no longer hold the old hexes.

**The accent trap.** `--accent` (the *token*) is champagne `#C4B49C`. But `docs/design-direction.md` principle 3 says the *interface* accent is **white and its alpha steps**, and it marks STATE (active / playing / selected / focused) — not every button. `lib/theme/colors.ts` (`CHAMPAGNE_ACCENT = '#FFFFFF'`) maps legacy beige values onto white. Both are true at once: champagne governs surfaces and brand chrome, white/alpha governs control state. When in doubt, follow `design-direction.md`.

**Control language** — translucent is the default: rest `bg-white/[0.06]` + `border-white/10`, hover `bg-white/[0.10]` + `border-white/20`, active `bg-white/[0.14]` + `border-white/30`, disabled `opacity-40`. Solid-white fills are a rare single-primary-action exception (floating cart pill, empty-cart CTA, checkout Pay). Icon-only controls carry **no fill at rest** — prominence comes from size and spacing.

**Radii vocabulary:** 8px controls · 12px cards · 20px modals/heroes. Nothing else.

**Other canonical tokens:** `--text-readable #AAA294` (WCAG-AA floor for text a user must actually read — the decorative tertiary fades fail AA), `--text-muted #706B61`, `--error #8d3a2f` / `--error-strong #ff8b73` / `--error-text #ffb7a8`, `--star #FFFFFF`, z-layers `--z-popover 200` / `--z-drawer 220` / `--z-modal 240`, motion `--dur-fast 160ms` / `--dur-med 260ms` / `--ease-spring` / `--ease-decelerate`.

**Alternate theme:** `[data-theme="de-roche-archive"]` is a light inversion of the semantic layer. Anything hardcoded breaks it.

**Generated artwork** — tracks without a cover get a deterministic brand gradient (`lib/artwork/gradient.ts`, seeded by track id — never `Math.random()`, which shimmers on scroll and desyncs library vs storefront). Tag colours in `lib/artwork/tag-colors.ts` (migration 107); per-kind default artwork + producer logo in migrations 108/109.

**DB** — migrations append-only, idempotent (`IF NOT EXISTS`). End each schema change with `NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';`. RLS on every owned table. **Owner-only, not owner-or-null** — mig 097 retired the legacy `user_id IS NULL` allowance and mig 111 adopts remaining orphan contacts onto the owner. Service-role routes bypass RLS, so they must apply the owner filter themselves and must not re-add `,user_id.is.null`. Apply migrations on Supabase BEFORE merging dependent PRs. Highest number on disk = **113**; confirmed-applied baseline = **106** (full clean replay, 2026-08-05) — `107`…`113` are newer and unverified, so check `supabase/MIGRATIONS.md` for current applied status rather than assuming. Number the next new migration **114**. `096/097/098/099` each have two files sharing a number from a past parallel-branch collision — both sides are legitimate and applied; don't renumber them. Always check `git log --all -- supabase/migrations/` before naming, especially from a worktree off a stale base.

**Auth** — Supabase via `@supabase/ssr`, Google OAuth (producer) + magic-link OTP (buyers). Refresh in `src/proxy.ts` (must run on `/api/*`). Public-by-design: `/share/*`, `/projects/share/*`, `/store/**`, `/embed/*`. Service-role key is server-only. Buyer identity is **email**, not a `user_id` — writes go only through `/api/store/me` (RLS blocks direct PostgREST; migration 060).

**CSP** — `src/proxy.ts` builds a strict nonce-based Content-Security-Policy and ships it **Report-Only** (`CSP_ENFORCE = false`); violations POST to `/api/csp-report`. Enforcing it white-screens statically-rendered pages, because Next's build-time inline bootstrap can't take a per-request nonce. Any new external script/frame/connect origin must be added to `buildCsp()` or it will be reported now and broken the day enforcement flips. `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` is there for Essentia/audio-decode; dev-mode HMR trips `'unsafe-eval'` — that's a dev-only false positive, do NOT add it.

**Players** — two: persistent `PlayerBar` (Zustand `usePlayer`) and DAW `PlayerCanvas` (own ws instance, mounted on project-share). Both via `useWaveSurfer`. Region-pinned comments use `region_start/end` (migration 013).

**Cover Art Studio** (`/cover-art`, `components/cover-art/*`) — layer-based artwork editor. `CoverArtStudio.tsx` owns state; `StudioCanvas` handles pointer input; `LayerView` renders a layer; the panels are presentational. Rules that matter:

- **The canvas and the export must agree.** `LayerView` (DOM) and `renderArtworkDocumentSvg` (SVG) draw the same document two different ways, so any new layer property has to be implemented in BOTH. Shared crop maths lives in `imageCropDefaults` / `imageFrameRect` precisely so the two cannot drift. We shipped a canvas that drew every image layer as a grey placeholder while the export drew the real thing; don't recreate that.
- **Exports must embed fonts.** `svgToRasterBlob` rasterises through `new Image()`, and an SVG loaded as an image cannot read the page's `@font-face` rules or fetch `/fonts/*`. Anything leaving the app goes through `embedFontsInSvg` (`lib/cover/font-embed.ts`) or it ships in a fallback system face. Same reason images are inlined as data URIs rather than R2 URLs.
- **Interaction maths is pure and tested.** `lib/cover/geometry.ts` (resize-with-rotation, snapping, group scaling), `lib/cover/collage.ts` (layouts), `lib/cover/waveform.ts` (resampling + bar geometry). Per the "pure-logic extract" rule below — this is exactly the logic that gets silently reverted when it hides inside a component.
- **Persistence is IndexedDB, not localStorage** (`lib/cover/document-store.ts`, DB `antigravity-cover-art`). Image layers carry their bytes inline, so a collage is several megabytes and would blow localStorage's quota at the worst possible moment. Separate DB from `antigravity-offline` so version upgrades can't collide.
- **Undo history is one atomic state** (`{ doc, past, future }`). It was three `useState`s with nested setState calls inside each other's updaters; React may run an updater twice, the stacks desynced, and redo silently did nothing.
- **Waveforms downsample by bucket peak, never by point sampling.** `lib/cover/waveform.ts`. Interpolating between two source samples lands between transients as often as on them, so a kick disappears and the waveform reads as soft noise. There are also no frequency "lanes" — the old builder derived them from `index % 6` / `index % 3`, which is arithmetic on the bar's position and carries no audio information at all; it then painted them in two fixed blues that fought the warm palette. One colour, from the artwork's own palette.
- **The studio uses the app's design tokens, not a parallel palette.** The original lab shipped its own near-miss set — `#EEE8DD` text, `#10100D` panels, `#0D0D0A` fields, `#C7B89D` accent, translucent `#EBE1CC1A` borders, and blue/teal waveform colours — which read as a different, browner product sitting inside the app. Everything now resolves to the documented tokens (`#0a0907`, `#14110d`, `#E8DCC8`, `#a08a6a`, `#6a5d4a`, `#D4BFA0`, borders `#1f1a13` / `#2d2620`). `defaultArtworkPalette` matches them too. Only the four art *directions* deliberately diverge, because differing is what a direction is for.
- **Documents saved before a palette change keep their old palette**, since the palette is stored on the document. That is correct — it is the producer's artwork — but it means a stale saved cover is not evidence the tokens are wrong.
- **The studio's height is `calc(100vh-10.5rem)`, derived from `(dashboard)/layout.tsx`'s `main.pt-14.pb-28`.** A guessed value was 68px too tall, so the page scrolled instead of the panels and the bottom of the inspector was unreachable. Change both together.
- **The studio panels must collapse below ~1180px.** The rail plus both panels are 600px of fixed chrome; as plain grid columns they squeezed the canvas to a sliver and overflowed the container. Below that width they leave the grid and float over the canvas instead.
- **Window pointer listeners attach unconditionally.** Gating the listener effect on a ref means gestures that change no state (resize, rotate) never get listeners at all, because setting a ref doesn't schedule a render.

**Interaction hierarchy** — `direct manipulation → contextual popover → dropdown → modal → deep editor`. Pick the leftmost rung that can do the job. A control that changes exactly one property must not open a screen.

- **One editor per property.** `ui/InlineText` is the click-to-edit field (Enter saves, ⌘/Ctrl+Enter in multiline, Escape cancels, **blur saves** — discarding on blur throws away typing whenever the user clicks away). A ⋯ menu never grows its own copy of an editor the page can already show; it takes an `onEditX` prop and focuses the real one. `ProjectOptionsMenu` and `PlaylistOptionsMenu` used to render a rename `<input>` *inside the menu*, so rename existed twice and the menu version was the only discoverable one.
- **Menus are `ui/ActionMenu`, never hand-rolled.** Grouping/ordering is the pure model in `lib/ui/action-menu.ts` (Vitest-covered): sections render in declaration order **except** `danger: true`, which is always pinned last; hidden items are dropped before keyboard indices are assigned; a menu with zero visible items renders no trigger at all. Items support `shortcutKey` (single-letter accelerator while open), `checked`, `busy`, `hint`, and `'keep-open'` returns. Positioning mirrors `ui/Dropdown` — portaled, `position: fixed` with raw rect coords (never add `window.scrollY`), flips up near the viewport bottom. Focus is **not** trapped: `role="menu"` must let Tab out.
- **`role="menu"` is a promise.** It tells a screen reader the thing is arrow-navigable, so declaring it without implementing arrow keys is worse than not declaring it. Only two components own that role: `ui/ActionMenu` and `cover-art/ContextMenu` (pointer-positioned, so it can't be trigger-anchored — it borrows the same `nextEnabledIndex` / `firstEnabledIndex` maths rather than copying the rules). Everything else that needs a menu uses `ActionMenu`. A popover of **navigation links** is not a menu: TopBar's hub popover is a labelled `<nav>`, because the ARIA menu pattern is for application commands and `<a>` elements already answer Tab.
- **Tags are `ui/InlineTagStrip`.** Pills remove in one click; adding opens a popover. The name→category lookup is in `lib/ui/tag-groups.ts` because both POST and DELETE need the category and the strip only holds the tag name — sending the wrong one succeeds and changes nothing.
- **The uploads tray owns post-upload metadata.** `components/upload/UploadsTray` renames and tags the created track in place, using the `track` the manager stores from `/complete`. Guard both with `canEditUploadedTrack` (`lib/upload/row-actions.ts`): `/complete` can succeed without returning a track, and an editor bound to `undefined` PATCHes `/api/tracks/undefined`. Which buttons a row shows comes from `uploadRowActions(status)` — one source, not five inline conditionals plus a parent-computed `isActive` flag beside the status it was derived from. A row never offers both Cancel and Dismiss; they render the same X and mean opposite things.
- **Settings is thin on purpose, but it must not send you through a tombstone.** Its License Builder card links to `/store-editor#licenses` — the canonical builder — not to `/settings/licenses`, whose entire content is a notice saying the builder moved. `/store-editor` reads the URL hash on mount and expands + scrolls to the matching section (`section-<id>` anchors), so any part of the app can deep-link a section instead of dropping the producer at the top of a fourteen-section accordion.
- **Price semantics: blank ≠ free.** `lib/store-editor/beat-row.ts` — `parsePriceInput` returns `null` for an empty field, meaning "inherit the producer's profile default" (mig 021). Storing `0` there publishes a catalogue for nothing. `hasSellablePrice` is the single rule for "does this beat have a price a buyer could pay", shared by the Needs-attention counter and the row filter so the two cannot disagree; it was a closure declared ~800 lines below its first use, which put it in the temporal dead zone the moment anything above it needed the rule.
- Component behaviour of this kind is covered by jsdom tests (`// @vitest-environment jsdom` pragma, `@testing-library/react`). A menu that renders perfectly can still be unusable by keyboard and put Delete next to Rename; neither `tsc` nor `next build` sees it.

**Cover Art effects + type** — two shared modules the studio's two renderers both read:

- **`lib/cover/effects.ts` emits ONE `<filter>` def that both surfaces use.** The canvas inlines it in a hidden `<svg><defs>` and references it with CSS `filter: url(#fx-canvas-ID)`; the exporter inlines the same def and uses `filter="url(#fx-ID)"`. There is deliberately no parallel CSS-filter string to drift. The only legitimate difference is the `scale` argument — `zoom` on the canvas, `1` in the export — because a blur is in document units. `baseFrequency` (grain) DIVIDES by scale where every other length multiplies; getting that backwards makes grain coarsen as you zoom and the export come back finer than what was approved.
- **The filter nests INSIDE the transform, and vignette sits outside the filter.** Filter+clip-path on one element clips the drop shadow away with the crop. Filter outside the transform gives document-space shadows in the export and layer-space on the canvas — two pictures of one layer. Vignette is painted, not filtered, so a blur cannot smear it.
- **`lib/cover/fonts.ts` is the single type registry.** Font handling used to live in four places that disagreed: the exporter hardcoded `font-weight:700` while the canvas set none, `globals.css` maps Synkopy's 700 onto the *Flipside* cut, and only one Panchang weight was ever embedded. `nearestFace` snaps a requested weight to one the family actually ships **before** either renderer sees it, so neither is asked to synthesise. All 11 shipped `.otf` files are reachable; La Bruja is now registered in `globals.css`.
- **Artboard resizing scales effects too** (`lib/cover/artboard.ts`). Blur/shadow/glow/chromatic are document units — a 24-unit blur is a haze at 3000px and a smear at 1080px.
- **Export settings resolve honestly** (`lib/cover/export-settings.ts`). A transparent JPEG gives you a BLACK plate, so `resolveExport` drops the request and reports it in `notes` for the UI to surface rather than silently doing something else.

**Cover Art moods** (`lib/cover/restyle.ts`) — `restyleDocument` changes how existing work FEELS without replacing it: typography, effects and palette move together, while positions, sizes, text and image sources stay put. Distinct from `coverArtDirections`, which call `createArtworkDocument` and throw the layer stack away. Deliberately NOT a model call: a mood is a curated set of parameter choices, so this is instant, free, offline, identical every time and one undo step, where an LLM emitting layer JSON would be slower, cost per press and occasionally fail to parse. Tracking is SCALED not set, `fx` is merged with the mood winning on keys it names, and locked layers and groups are skipped (a group holds no pixels; restyling its wrapper would double the effect on its contents).

**Cover Art groups + rulers**:

- **Nesting is a `parentId` pointer on the flat `layers` array, not a `children` tree.** Every existing consumer that walks `document.layers` still sees every layer. Children keep ABSOLUTE document coordinates — a group is a wrapper for opacity/blend/organisation, NOT a coordinate space, which is the only reason `lib/cover/geometry.ts` needs no knowledge of groups.
- **`expandToLeaves` is the load-bearing function.** Move, resize, align and snapping all run on it, so a selected group contributes no rect of its own and its stored rect never has to be kept in sync. `beginMove` also keeps a group selected when the press lands on one of its descendants — without that, grabbing a group's contents replaced the selection with the child under the cursor and a group could never be dragged.
- **Both renderers recurse.** A group emits a wrapper with opacity+blend and NO transform (children are absolute; transforming the wrapper would move them twice). On the canvas the wrapper is `pointer-events:none` and every leaf sets `auto`, or a group blankets the artboard and swallows clicks.
- **Deleting a group deletes its descendants**, and `moveLayer`/`reorderLayer` operate within a sibling set — both merge back into the full array. Returning just the sibling set drops every other layer from the document. `descendantIds`/`isDescendantOf`/`layerRows` all carry cycle guards.
- **Guides live on the document but the exporter never reads them** — that is enforced by a test asserting the SVG is byte-identical with and without guides. Collapsing a group goes through `setDocumentQuietly`, since folding a panel is not an undo step.
- **A guide drag is computed from a snapshot taken at drag start.** Reading the live document mid-drag is a race: two pointermoves can fire before React flushes, so the second reads the pre-move list, fails to find the guide at its updated origin, and leaves a duplicate at every position the pointer passed.

**Cover Art text-on-path** (`lib/cover/text-path.ts`) — `<textPath>` has no DOM equivalent, so the canvas renders curved text as an inline `<svg>` in document units (the same trick the waveform layers use) and both surfaces run the IDENTICAL `d` string through an identical `<textPath>`. A test asserts the exported `d` equals `textPathD(...)` for every shape; that equality is the whole "no approximation to drift" claim. A path is a single run — `flattenForPath` joins lines with spaces rather than silently dropping all but the first, and the inspector says so when the text contains a break. `startOffset` and `text-anchor` must agree or the string runs off the end of the path.

**Store Editor — the storefront layout document** (`lib/store-editor/layout.ts`, `components/store-editor/*`, migration 113):

- **`/store` renders its sections from the layout.** `defaultStoreLayout()` reproduces the page's original hardcoded order exactly, and `normalizeLayout` turns null/older/malformed documents into it — so a producer who never opens the builder sees no change. There is a test asserting that order; if it drifts, every un-arranged storefront silently rearranges.
- **Overrides are sparse and desktop writes the base.** `resolveSection` layers `defaults → base → breakpoint`. Editing on desktop writes `base` so it flows down; tablet/mobile write only the keys they change. Replacing the object wholesale resets everything the breakpoint did not name.
- **`sectionCapabilities` keeps controls honest.** The storefront components own their own padding and responsive grids, so spacing/columns are offered only for sections this feature actually lays out. A control the preview obeys and the live page ignores is worse than no control.
- **Visibility is CSS, not a JS branch** (`visibilityClasses`) — `/store` is SSR'd and edge-cached, so branching would bake one device's layout into the cached HTML. `useStoreBreakpoint` exists only for the hero, where the two variants are different *components* (the particle canvas must not run on a phone at all).
- **`catalog` and `trust` are pinned** (`isPinnedSection`). The catalogue owns the sticky filter toolbar directly above it. The document itself refuses to move them rather than accepting a drag the storefront would ignore.
- **Free-form blocks are percentages of their section frame** (`lib/store-editor/canvas-blocks.ts`), never pixels — that is what stops a hand-composed panel hanging off a phone, and it means the drag maths needs no zoom argument: a scaled element's `getBoundingClientRect()` is already in screen pixels, so a ratio against it is correct at any zoom. Clamping is against the block's own size, so a wide block stops when its RIGHT edge reaches the frame. `SectionRenderer` takes editing as an OPTIONAL `editBlocks` prop the storefront never passes, so the capability is absent on the live page rather than switched off.
- **One module opens the Store Editor's IndexedDB** (`lib/store-editor/db.ts`). Versions are per-DATABASE, not per-store, so history opening at v1 while the saved-section library opened at v2 would throw `VersionError` — and which feature the producer touched first would decide whether the other worked. Adding a store means bumping the version there once and extending the one upgrade handler, which creates only what is missing.
- **A saved section stores everything EXCEPT its id and lock** (`lib/store-editor/library.ts`). Reusing an id would put two sections in one layout under one key: the second insert shadows the first in every lookup and `updateSection` edits both. The id is minted on insert, which is what makes "insert twice" ordinary.
- **Copying a style never copies visibility** (`lib/store-editor/section-style.ts`), and paste is filtered through `sectionCapabilities` so a style from a text block lands on a hero as only what the hero honours. Pasting also merges into existing overrides rather than replacing them, or a style mentioning only spacing would wipe a tablet alignment the target had.
- **Version history is IndexedDB, per-browser** (`lib/store-editor/history.ts`, DB `antigravity-store-editor`). Snapshots are taken AFTER the server accepts a save, so history never offers a version that was never stored, and `shouldSnapshot` declines both unchanged layouts and anything within `SNAPSHOT_MIN_GAP_MS` — without that, autosave during a slider drag fills the history with near-identical entries and evicts everything worth restoring. `sameLayout` ignores `updatedAt` deliberately, since it changes on every keystroke. Restoring goes through `commit`, so it lands on the undo stack rather than needing a confirmation dialog. The panel degrades to a notice when IndexedDB is denied (private browsing) rather than taking the builder with it.
- **`store_layout` is fetched in its own query** in `/api/store`. Folding it into the existing newer-columns select would fail that whole select — and silently drop accent colour, socials and voice tags from every storefront — on any deploy where migration 113 has not been applied.

**Share variants** — `recipient_kind ∈ {client, producer, rapper, friend}` drives which `components/share/variants/*` renders.

**Storefront** — `/store` is public-by-design. Tracks listed when `tracks.store_listed = true`; projects featured when `projects.store_featured = true`. Buying:
- **Track licenses** — `BeatCard` / `BandcampRemixCard` (type=remix) / `MusicPortfolio` row → preview drawer → cart (`useCart`) → `/store/checkout` → embedded Stripe (`createEmbeddedCheckoutPage`) → webhook (`purchase_kind: 'track_license'`) → `license_purchases` row + Resend delivery email pointing at `/store/download?session_id=…`.
- **Project bundles** — `/store/projects/[id]` → "Buy bundle" → `/store/checkout?project_id=…` → embedded Stripe (`purchase_kind: 'project'`) → webhook writes `project_access_links` (token + frozen `amount_usd` from `session.amount_total`) → delivery email points at `/store/projects/access/<token>`.
- **Promo codes** — `promo_codes` table; `/api/store/promo` validates; checkout server distributes discount across line items (percent → uniform per-line; flat → proportional split; min unit_amount = $0.01).
- **Filter + sort logic lives in `lib/store/filters.ts`** (`filterAndSortTracks`) — pure function, Vitest-covered. Page useMemo delegates to it. Don't re-inline; the test suite is what catches AI revert wipes.
- **Wishlist** — `useWishlist` (Zustand + localStorage, key `antigravity-wishlist`). Optional `isWishlisted` / `onToggleWishlist` props on `BeatCard` / `BandcampRemixCard` / `MusicPortfolio` rows.
- **Cart** — `useCart` (Zustand + localStorage). `CartDrawer` stays mounted (`open` prop) instead of unmounting on close — preserves email + promo input across navigation.
- **Buyer accounts (opt-in)** — magic-link OTP or Google at `/store/account`; favourites, listening history and playlists keyed on **email**, written only via `/api/store/me` (migration 060). Separate from the legacy 24h `/store/account/[token]` delivery link — no merge step between them.
- **Funnel telemetry** — `/api/store/event` + `/api/store/play` feed `store_events` (migration 097); aggregation logic is pure in `lib/store/funnel.ts`. Social proof ("N sold this week") comes from `lib/store/momentum.ts`.
- **Store readiness** — `lib/store/readiness.ts` splits HARD blockers (not listed, no price — literally unpurchasable) from conversion issues (no cover/tags/metadata). Keep that split; a diagnostic that overstates gets ignored.
- **Exclusive sale race** — the webhook claims exclusivity with an atomic conditional `UPDATE … WHERE exclusive_sold = false … RETURNING` and flags the losing buyer via `license_purchases.needs_refund_review` (migration 106), surfaced on `/sales` with "Mark reviewed" (`POST /api/sales/resolve-refund-review`). **No Stripe refund API call exists anywhere in this repo** — refunding stays a manual producer action in the Stripe dashboard.
- **Exclusive stems-pending flow** — exclusive purchases of tracks without `wav_url` or ready `stems_status` are NOT rejected at checkout (changed from the old gate-the-sale policy). Checkout writes `metadata.stems_pending_track_ids` (CSV of affected track ids); the webhook flips `license_purchases.needs_stems_upload = true` (mig 052) and emails the producer to upload. `/sales` shows an "Awaiting stems" badge on those rows.

**Stripe** — Two checkout surfaces:
- Share-page checkout — `/api/share/[token]/checkout`, buy gated on `share.sales_enabled === true`.
- Store checkout — `/api/store/checkout`, cart-mode and project-mode in one route.

Common: `ui_mode: 'embedded_page'` (server); `stripe.createEmbeddedCheckoutPage({ clientSecret })` (client). Webhook (`/api/stripe/webhook`) signature-verified via `req.text()` (NOT `req.json()`); idempotent on `processed_stripe_events` (event-level) and `license_purchases.stripe_session_id` / `project_access_links.stripe_session_id` (purchase-level). Branches on `metadata.purchase_kind ∈ {track_license, project}`. Health check: `GET /api/stripe/diagnostics`.

**Cron** — `vercel.json` schedule, route validates `Authorization: Bearer ${CRON_SECRET}` before any work. Seven jobs today: `nudge-stale`, `publish-scheduled`, `abandoned-carts`, `announce-drops`, `process-uploads`, `migrate-legacy-audio`, `process-fulfillment-emails`. Routes exist without a schedule too (`backfill-peaks`, `backfill-previews`, `cleanup-stripe-events`, `fulfillment-alerts`, `reconcile-payments`) — adding one to `vercel.json` is a separate, deliberate step. Region is `cdg1`.

## Commands
```bash
npm run dev            # next dev (Turbopack)
npm run build          # next build (includes tsc --noEmit)
npm test               # vitest run

CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `tsc --noEmit` → `vitest` → `next build` on push to `main` and on every PR.

## Env vars
**Required prod:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `R2_BUCKET_NAME` (public derivatives/assets), `R2_PRIVATE_BUCKET_NAME` (masters/WAV/stems), `NEXT_PUBLIC_R2_PUBLIC_URL`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://uche-beatstore-g.vercel.app`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `CRON_SECRET`.

**Optional:** `MOISES_API_KEY` (legacy stems), `DEMUCS_SERVICE_URL` (current stems service), `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUDD_API_TOKEN`, `ENABLE_LOCAL_STORE=true`, `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (`whsec_…`; enables `/api/resend/webhook` open/click tracking → `beat_sends.opened_at/link_clicked_at`. Unset = route accepts events without signature verification, dev only), `NEXT_PUBLIC_R2_CDN_URL` (Cloudflare-cached custom domain in front of the R2 bucket, e.g. `https://cdn.uche-beatstore.com`; when set, the bottom player's `SimpleAudioEngine` streams previews from it instead of `r2.dev`. Unset = direct `r2.dev` public URL — still bypasses the `/api/audio` proxy, just not edge-cached. See `lib/audio/cdn.ts`), `SHARE_MEDIA_TOKEN_SECRET` (HMAC secret for signed share preview/peaks grants — falls back to `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, and **throws in production** if neither is set), `SENTRY_DSN` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` / `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE`, `LOG_LEVEL`, `FFMPEG_BIN`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `GEMINI_API_KEY` / `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY` (either of the first two enables AI image generation in the Cover Art Studio; read server-side only — `/api/cover/generate` reports which are configured and never accepts a key from the browser), `SUPABASE_DB_URL` (only for `npm run db:migrate`), `READINESS_BASE_URL`.

**Player audio path** — `tracks.audio_url`, `wav_url`, and stem URLs may be opaque `r2://bucket/key` references. Dashboard playback resolves those through authenticated `/api/audio`; public store playback uses `tracks.preview_url` through `/api/store/preview/[id]`. Never expose or rewrite a private `r2://` reference into public JSON. Public derivatives can still use `NEXT_PUBLIC_R2_CDN_URL`.

## Dashboard config (prod)
- **R2 CORS** must include `https://uche-beatstore-g.vercel.app` for `GET/PUT/POST/HEAD` — else "waveform unavailable."
- Direct multipart upload also requires the private bucket CORS policy to allow `PUT` from the production origin and expose the `ETag` response header.
- **R2 buckets:** `R2_BUCKET_NAME` is public and contains previews/covers/peaks/voice tags. `R2_PRIVATE_BUCKET_NAME` must have no public development URL and contains masters/WAV/stems. Any cloud-backed audio upload fails closed when the private bucket variable is missing; local filesystem fallback is only used when R2 itself is not configured.
- **Supabase Auth URL config:** Site URL = prod domain; Redirect URLs include `/auth/callback` and `/**`.
- **Google OAuth:** authorized redirect URI is the SUPABASE callback (`https://<ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`), not your domain.
- **Stripe webhook:** `/api/stripe/webhook` subscribed to `checkout.session.completed`, `charge.refunded`, `charge.dispute.created`.

## Gotchas
- **The palette in an old CLAUDE.md is not the palette.** `#D4BFA0` burnt amber was replaced app-wide; an agent styled against it and shipped wrong colours. Read `src/app/globals.css` + `docs/design-direction.md`, and see "Colour + design tokens" above — the measured table there is what components actually use.
- **Three source-text guard tests exist and they are load-bearing** — they catch defect classes `tsc`, ESLint and a green build all miss:
  - `lib/ui/tailwind-classes.test.ts` — malformed opacity modifiers (`ring-white/30/40`, `border-white/`) compile to *nothing*. A scripted colour migration once introduced 167 of them, killing focus rings on store cards and checkout.
  - `lib/ui/reduced-motion.test.ts` — any `animate-pulse` / `animate-bounce` not gated on `useReducedMotion()` (allowlist for genuinely transient loading feedback).
  - `lib/source-hygiene.test.ts` — raw control characters in source. A literal NUL byte makes `grep` treat the file as binary and `git diff` unreviewable.
- **Don't script a styling migration.** One documented incident left 144 dead Tailwind classes, another the 167 malformed modifiers above. Hand-edit, or write a guard test first.
- **CSP is Report-Only, so a violation looks like nothing at all today** — but a new CDN script, iframe, or `connect-src` origin must still be added to `buildCsp()` in `src/proxy.ts`.
- **Public store media must never carry a private URL.** `lib/store/public-media.ts#redactPublicTrackMedia` nulls `preview_url` / `wav_url` and swaps `audio_url` for the public preview derivative (CDN direct when configured, `/api/store/preview/[id]` otherwise). Share pages use short-lived HMAC grants (`lib/share-media-token.ts`, 15-min TTL) — routing public share media through the session-gated `/api/audio` proxy is a bug we've already shipped and fixed.
- **Pure logic goes in `lib/`, not in the component.** This project has silently reverted in-component logic more than once. Established pure modules: `store/filters.ts`, `store/discount.ts`, `store/readiness.ts`, `store/momentum.ts`, `library/triage.ts`, `library/columns.ts`, `dashboard/action-digest.ts`, `ui/toast-queue.ts`, `artwork/gradient.ts`. Extend one rather than inlining a new copy.
- **Triage state is derived, not stored** (`lib/library/triage.ts`) — no status column, so it classifies the whole back catalogue retroactively. Don't "fix" it by adding a column.
- **Overlays need `useDialogBehavior`** — dialogs get the full focus trap, menus/popovers get `trapFocus: false` (trapping a dropdown strands keyboard users). ~25 overlays are already retrofitted; a new one that skips it is inconsistent, not just unpolished.
- **Buyer emails are matched lowercased.** `contacts.email`, `license_purchases.buyer_email`, `buyer_favorites.email` and friends key the buyer→contact link. Normalise with `normalizeEmail` from `lib/contacts/email.ts` on **every** write — `contacts_user_email_uniq (user_id, email)` is case-sensitive, so raw casing forks one human into two contacts and makes their orders unfindable via `/store/orders`.
- **Upserting contacts?** The only unique index is `(user_id, email)`. `onConflict: 'email'` raises Postgres 42P10 — and because supabase-js *resolves* with `{ error }` rather than throwing, a bare `try/catch` never sees it. Destructure `.error` and log it.
- `"Could not find column X in schema cache"` → run `NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';`, wait 10s.
- **PostgREST `.or()` interpolation footgun** — commas inside a value break the filter because PostgREST treats them as condition separators. Validate any interpolated id (e.g. `safeSellerId()` in `/api/store/route.ts` for UUIDs) before building the filter string.
- **Stripe SDK renames have bitten us twice.** Server: `ui_mode: 'embedded'` is removed → use `'embedded_page'`; `automatic_payment_methods` is rejected for embedded sessions, drop it. Client: `initEmbeddedCheckout` was removed in `@stripe/stripe-js@9.x` → use `stripe.createEmbeddedCheckoutPage({ clientSecret })`. Use the typed call (no `as any`) so the next rename fails at compile time.
- **The `(dashboard)` group requires auth via `src/proxy.ts`**; `(auth)` and `store/*` do not. Easy to put a new page in the wrong group and either expose private data or 401 a public visitor.
- **`prefers-reduced-motion` matters** — `MusicArtwork`, `ParticleText`, `MusicPortfolio`, the cosmos `.track-masonry` fade, and the vinyl spin all gate animation on it. Respect that pattern in new visual components.
- Don't add `window.scrollY` to fixed-positioned portals. Bounding-rect coords are viewport-relative.
- `npm run dev` is permissive about imports; `npm run build` (and CI) catches them. Always build before PR.
- Two share routes: legacy `/share/[token]`, modern `/projects/share/[token]`. New work in the latter.
- If new code depends on an open PR, branch off that PR — not `main`.
- No Radix/Headless UI — primitives are hand-rolled by choice.
- IndexedDB owns audio blobs; service worker owns app shell. Keep them separate.
- **Worktree contamination** — sub-agents have created `.claude/worktrees/agent-*` that get locked on crash. Cleanup: `git worktree unlock <path>` → `git worktree remove --force <path>` → `git branch -D worktree-<id>`.
- **Migration numbering races** — when two parallel branches both add migrations, both will claim the next number. Check `git log --all -- supabase/migrations/` before naming. We renumbered 040/041 → 046/047 once already.
- **SVG-as-image is a sandbox.** Anything rasterised via `new Image()` — cover art export, share cards — cannot fetch *any* external resource: no fonts, no stylesheets, no cross-origin images. Inline it as a data URI or it will silently render wrong while the on-screen version looks right.
- **Panchang has no glyph for the shift (U+21E7) or option (U+2325) symbols.** They render as tofu. Spell out "Shift" and "Alt" in keyboard hints; the command symbol is fine.
- **`coverArtExportPresets` is a Record keyed by id, not an array.** `Object.values()` it before mapping.
- **A centred overflowing scroll container clips its own start edge.** `place-items: center` makes the top/left of a zoomed-in artboard unreachable; use `place-items: safe center`.
- **`bg-white/[0.04]/70` paints nothing** — a modifier stacked on an arbitrary opacity value matches no utility and computes to `rgba(0,0,0,0)`. 52 of them survived across 30 files (Settings' team rows and preference toggles, the player bar, share variants, the upload drop zone) because `lib/ui/tailwind-classes.test.ts` only checked the plain-numeric form `white/30/40`. It now checks both. They are residue of the scripted colour migration (3fe5698), which rewrote `bg-[#171511]/70` → `bg-white/[0.04]/70` and left the old alpha dangling; the fix is to DROP the trailing modifier, not multiply the two — multiplying makes the surface darker than every sibling the migration handled correctly. Watch for a rest state that ends up identical to its `hover:` after the fix.
- **AGENTS.md is the product spec, not a build-order prompt.** Update it when you change the product, not when you change the code.

## Adding a feature
1. **Migration first** (if schema change): `supabase/migrations/NNN_descriptor.sql`, idempotent, ends with `NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';`. Apply on Supabase before merging dependent code.
2. **Zod contract** in `lib/contracts/` for any mutation body.
3. **Route handler** — owner-gated (`requireRowOwnership` / `requireUser`), Zod-validated, `errorMessage(err)` on failure, `createLogger('api.x.y')` for diagnostics.
4. **Pure-logic extract** — when the feature has filter / sort / scoring / pricing logic, write it as a pure function in `lib/` first (`filterAndSortTracks` is the template). Vitest the helper. **Logic inside React components can't be tested in isolation and gets silently reverted** — we've shipped this regression twice.
5. **UI** with existing semantic tokens (no new colours, no hardcoded hex, no new font imports) — check it against `docs/design-direction.md` and the radii/control-language rules above.
6. **Wire on the page**; update `lib/types/` if a public shape changed.
7. **`npm run build && npm test`** locally (the guard tests in `lib/ui/` and `lib/source-hygiene.test.ts` run here and catch what `tsc` can't); `npm run e2e` when a storefront or project/playlist flow changed. Pre-commit hook (if enabled) double-checks staged TS.
8. **PR** with Summary / Why / Test plan / Required prod config / Migrations to apply. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) will gate the merge.

## API map (high-level, public + dashboard)
Roughly 200 route files — this is the shape, not the inventory. `find src/app/api -name route.ts` is the source of truth.
- **Public storefront** — `/api/store` (catalogue), `/api/store/[id]`, `/api/store/facets`, `/api/store/drops`, `/api/store/momentum`, `/api/store/beat-match`, `/api/store/playlists/[id]`, `/api/store/projects/[id]`, `/api/store/projects/access/[token]{,/download,/peaks}`, `/api/store/projects/access/by-session`, `/api/store/producer/[slug]`, `/api/store/checkout`, `/api/store/promo`, `/api/store/offer{,/[id]}`, `/api/store/contact`, `/api/store/follow`, `/api/store/comments/[trackId]`, `/api/store/delivery`, `/api/store/download-file`, `/api/store/free-download{,s}`, `/api/store/orders{,/resend}`, `/api/store/event` + `/api/store/play` (funnel telemetry).

- **Public media** — `/api/store/preview/[id]`, `/api/store/peaks/[id]`, `/api/share/[token]/preview/[trackId]` + `/peaks/[trackId]` (HMAC-signed grants).
- **Public share** — `/api/share/[token]/{route,play,download,checkout,analytics}`, `/api/projects/share/[token]/{route,tracks,comments}`.
- **Producer (auth)** — `/api/tracks` (+ `/[id]/{analyze,announce,arrangement,heatmap,lyrics,peaks,rate,similar,tags,shares,versions,stem-files,stems/upload}`, `/auto-tag`, `/reorder`, `/stats`, `/store-summary`, `/tags/bulk`), `/api/projects`, `/api/playlists`, `/api/smart-playlists`, `/api/contacts` (+ `/tasks`, `/segments`, `/scores`, `/import`, `/tags/bulk`), `/api/beat_sends`, `/api/campaigns`, `/api/calendar`, `/api/events`, `/api/profile{,/voice-tag}`, `/api/licenses`, `/api/track-licenses`, `/api/promo-codes`, `/api/sales` (+ `/deliver-stems`, `/resend`, `/resolve-refund-review`), `/api/analytics`, `/api/links`, `/api/notifications`, `/api/team`, `/api/tags/colors`, `/api/cover/generate`, `/api/upload/*` (+ `/image`, `/status`), `/api/stems/*`, `/api/search`, `/api/activity`, `/api/whoami`, `/api/invite`, `/api/email`, `/api/words`, `/api/privacy/erase`.
